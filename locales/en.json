I've always been obsessed with tech and find it really facinating, i love to dabble into random areas to se what's going on, currenly split between choosing ML (i hate maths but love internal working) and webdev (got 0 design sense but love to create random stuff).  my techstack is weak as my adhd leads me to choose anything i find cool on youtube (golang and SvelteKit and currently trying out expo) ",
